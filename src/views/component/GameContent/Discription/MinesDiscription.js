              Join in on the Mines fever with one of our most popular and
              beloved games! Inspired by the classic Minesweeper, Mines will

              gambling game of chance developed by Listor where players navigate
              the grid to reveal gems while avoiding bombs! This Mines betting
              game is played on a 5x5 grid in which players can flip the tiles
              over to show either a gem or bomb.

            Revealing gems increases payout multipliers and allows players to

          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3 cursor-default">
            Players set their bet amount to play with during a round of Mines as
            well as the number of mines that exists in the field of play,
            ranging between 1-24. There are 25 tiles where gems and mines can be
            distributed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2 cursor-default">
            The gameplay resembles the beloved Minesweeper game, with the
            placement of mines and gems being random and betting mechanics
            included for any fiat, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

            Modifying the Number of Mines
          </h5>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3 cursor-default">
            The number of mines set affects to multiplier paid out to players
            and controls the volatility of the gameplay. More mines in play lead
            to more opportunities for a round to end, but also leads to exciting
            gameplay and higher payouts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2 cursor-default">
            The choice of setting the mines amount reflects the player's
            appetite for risk and the level of risk they are willing to burden
            in pursuit of profit and big payouts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3 cursor-default">
            Once the bet amount and number of mines have been set, players can
            click any number of tiles during the betting round to reveal their
            contents. Hitting a mine will end the round. However, if a player
            continues to collect gems they can continue to play.

            During the phase where players have collected gems and have not
            tripped any mines yet, the interface is modified and they are
            informed of the 'Profit on Next Tile' and 'Total Profit' in the
            current round.
