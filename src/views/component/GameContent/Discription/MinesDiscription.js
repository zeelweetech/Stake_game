          <h5 className="text-white font-bold pb-3">Mines Gameplay</h5>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            The gameplay resembles the beloved Minesweeper game, with the
            placement of mines and gems. Players set their amount to play with
            during a round of Mines as well as the number of mines that exists
            in the field of play, ranging between 1-24. There are 25 tiles where
            gems and mines can be distributed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2">
            During a round of Mines, players can set their desired amount for
            the individual round. Auto playing options are available which
            include the amount per round, number of mines, number of plays and
            options to stop on profit, stop on loss and adjust amount based on a
            win or a loss.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            As Mines is a game of random chance, with an element of human
            control in picking the tile and the ability to collect wins, it is a
            popular option for advanced strategies which is shared within the
            Stake community
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">

            Modifying the Number of Mines
          </h5>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            The number of mines set affects to multiplier paid out to players
            and controls the volatility of the gameplay. More mines in play lead
            to more opportunities for a round to end, but also leads to exciting
            gameplay and higher win potential.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2">
            The choice of setting the mines amount reflects the player's
            appetite for risk and the level of risk they are willing to burden
            in pursuit of big wins..
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            Once the amount and number of mines have been set, players can click
            any number of tiles during the round to reveal their contents.
            Hitting a mine will end the round. However, if a player continues to
            collect gems they can continue to play.
          </p>
          <h5 className="text-white font-bold pb-3">
            Collect Wins or Keep Mining
          </h5>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            During the phase where players have collected gems and have not
            tripped any mines yet, the interface is modified and they are
            informed of the 'Profit on Next Tile' and 'Total Profit' in the
            current round.

          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2">
