            How to Play Dragon Tower Online at Stake
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            The first thing to decide before playing Dragon Tower is how much
            you would like to play per game.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2">
            The game is unique in many respects, and you can even set the level
            of difficulty for the gameplay, choosing easy, medium, hard, expert,
            or master.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            The aim of the game is to guess which tiles in each row the dragon
            eggs will appear. If you guess correctly, you can earn an instant
            win or move up to the next level, unlocking multipliers as you go..
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            You can pick the boxes yourself or activate the auto-pick feature to
            do it for you.

            What are the Basic Rules of Dragon Tower?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            Dragon Tower takes place across a grid with individual tiles. The
            size of the grid (linked to the game’s difficulty level) determines
            how many tiles are in play at any given time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            As well as fewer boxes, the more advanced levels come with bigger
            multipliers that are added to your wins as you progress up the tower
            towards the dragon.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            Each time you click on a segment to reveal a dragon egg, you move up
            a level and unlock a higher multiplier. You are then given a chance
            to end the game.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            If you proceed and fail to reveal a dragon egg with your next
            selection, you will lose the multiplier and return to zero.
