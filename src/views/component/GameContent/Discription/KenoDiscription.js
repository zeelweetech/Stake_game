              and if you’ve picked correctly, you will receive your winnings
              based on the associated pay table.

            History of Keno Casino Games
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            It’s thought that the game of keno that we know and love today
            originated in China, even though the word “keno” has Latin roots. In
            China, the game has a legendary origin story.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            It’s said that the invention of keno saved an ancient Chinese city
            from destruction at a time of war, and the game's popularity in the
            years that followed helped to fund the Great Wall of China.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            However, it wasn’t until the nineteenth century that keno, in the
            form of a lottery, became widely accepted throughout Chinese
            society.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            In 1847, the Portuguese government of Macau granted a license to
            lottery operators for the first time. Throughout the rest of the
            century, keno became an important part of Chinese culture and
            tradition.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            In rural China, results of keno draws were sent to villages via
            carrier pigeons, resulting in the game becoming known as “white dove
            tickets” and “pigeon tickets” in certain Chinese regions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            Toward the end of the 19th century, the Chinese established a
            sophisticated keno system. The game used printed sheets of Chinese
            characters, typically the first eighty of the Thousand Character
            Classic.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            The first known introduction of keno outside of China was thought to
            be in Houston, Texas. The game was taken by Chinese immigrants -
            commissioned to work on constructing the first transcontinental
            railroad - to the state of Texas. It was initially known as “boc hop
            bu” in the United States, which was a westernisation of the
            Cantonese name of the game, translated to pigeon tickets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            However, by 1870, the Chinese lottery game had a new American name –
            keno. It quickly spread to other states and cities in the United
            States, and the rest, as they say, is history.

            Traditional Keno Games

            .In traditional games, your job is to select the number of
            consecutive draws (10-20 numbers) on a sheet of paper, ranging from
            1-80. In this regard, it’s similar to bingo and lottery games.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2">
            When the balls are drawn, you receive a payout depending on how many
            numbers you select accurately. Traditionally, keno is played with a
            ball machine with imprinted with numbers, which are entered into a
            transparent container, where they are spun and drawn.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            Ultimately, the more consecutive numbers you match on your keno
            card, the bigger your payout. One thing to note about keno is that
            the payouts in a single game will differ from platform to platform,
            so it’s important to check the paytable before placing a bet, so you
            know what you can win by making accurate selections.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3">
            Traditional keno games are extremely straightforward and have been
            popular for generations. But thanks to technological advancements
            and the prominence of online gaming, keno games today have many
            attractive features, as explained below.

            How to Play Keno Game Online
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            As is the case with online slots and table games , online keno is
            extremely popular today. In online keno, the structure and
            objectives of the game remain the same.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            The main difference is that online keno games rely on a random
            number generator (RNG) to reveal the winning numbers instead of a
            draw, which is the case in traditional keno.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            Another significant benefit of online keno games is that they
            typically comprise excellent graphics and are sometimes themed,
            making things more aesthetically pleasing and engaging for players.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            One of the best things about online keno is that you can play
            wherever you are, and you don’t need to wait for carrier pigeons to
            bring you the results! Instead, you can easily make your selections
            at the Listor Casino and learn how much you stand to win within
            seconds, with keno bonus offers and casino promotions available at
            Listor.

          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3">
            Before playing keno online, remember that it’s a game of luck. It’s
            not like certain card games that incorporate an element of skill and
            strategy, as the result of keno is based on a random number
            generator. However, there are still tips and tricks that can be
            incorporated, especially when playing the free demo game !
