            How to Play Limbo Casino Game
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3 cursor-default">
            Limbo is one of the easiest games you can play at Listor Casino, and
            it’s perfect for beginners and high rollers alike. To play, you need
            to be aware of two things:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 cursor-default">
            <li className="text-[15px] pb-2">The bet amount</li>
            <li className="text-[15px] pb-2">The target payout</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-2 cursor-default">
            Now, if the outcome of the round is higher than the target payout
            set, you will instantly win the amount that you bet, multiplied by
            the target. So, to give you an example, if you bet just 0.0001BTC,
            you could win 10BTC in a single betting round!
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] py-3 cursor-default">
            This Limbo game is so popular because there are hardly any other
            games that come close to offering this type of payout at any online
            casino, making it the ideal game for anyone looking for big wins.
          </p>
        </div>

            How Does Limbo Casino Game Work?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3 cursor-default">
            The outcomes in all Limbo betting rounds are completely randomised
            and are part of a two-step process. The first step is known as the
            float point, which is converted from generating random bytes using
            Listor’s RNG multiplied by the max payout (1,000,000x) and the game’s
            house edge (1%).
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3 cursor-default">
            Next, to generate a game event with probability distribution, the
            maximum possible multiplier is divided by the result of the first
            calculation to create a game event in the form of a crash point. So,
            although a maximum win is given (1,000,000), theoretically, the sky
            is the limit when betting Bitcoin and other crypto on this game.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[15px] pb-3 cursor-default">
            Probability distribution is key to delivering the various game
            outcomes in Limbo in a fair and completely randomised manner. At
            Listor.com, we ensure that this fair game has a high amount of
            variance from bet to bet and that randomised outcomes occur at all
            times.
