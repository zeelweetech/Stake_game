        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">5. Know Your Customer and Transaction Monitoring</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor will apply appropriate user due diligence and ongoing monitoring measures required by law. Listor will endeavour to prevent users from engaging in illicit or otherwise unauthorised activity. Listor uses a combination of its software development and other service agreements, which are enforced through internal operational features to ensure that it complies with the applicable law.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Know Your Customer</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          A. Customer Due Diligence.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor has adopted a risk based CDD to enable Listor to understand the nature and purpose of the user relationship to the Listor platform in order to develop a customer risk profile. In order to do so, Listor collects certain documentary and non-documentary information at account-opening commensurate with the nature of the type account and services that Listor offers. Listor maintains different CDD for different accounts and services.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          For instance, the CDD requires users go through Listor's customer identification program ("CIP"). The CIP consists of procedures for:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Collecting baseline (e.g., wallet address, email address) information at account creation through Listor's user onboarding portal;
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Monitoring the risk profile associated with the underlying cryptocurrency wallet used to fund the user's account;
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Maintaining records of the information used to identify the user; and
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Determining if a user appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organisations provided to the financial institutions based on the above information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          The above steps are operationalised using the following measures:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Identity and Age Verification. A third-party service provider will support's Listor's ability to determine the legitimacy of the identification information other KYC materials or information provided and will confirm that the user is permissible. The service provider also will confirm that the user does not appear to be located in a comprehensively-sanctioned or otherwise prohibited jurisdiction and will search global sanctions lists to confirm that the user does not appear thereon using onboarding information such as wallet addresses.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Customer Information. Listor will collect details on each user to form a reasonable belief that Listor knows the identity of its users commensurate with the user's risk profile. For instance, Listor may collect such details as the wallet address, name, address, country, date of birth, or postal code (collectively, "KYC Information"). Listor will collect any of the above KYC Information prior to allowing Listor funding privileges (e.g., QR code) to users. Listor does not presently allow users who are non-natural persons Listor may, at its own discretion rely on the performance by another institution of some or all of the elements of our CIP.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Geo-blocking for Prohibited Jurisdictions. Listor will require contractual client certifications that, through IP address-based geo-blocking, no gaming services will be offered in countries where such activity is not permitted.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Geo-blocking for Sanctioned Jurisdictions. Listor also will require contractual client certifications that such users are not subject to United States, European Union, or other global sanctions or watch lists, including individuals or entities associated with the United States' comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Syria and the Crimean region of Ukraine. Listor will implement risk-based measures to verify these representations including as in the below-described know-your-user ("KYC") measures and through IP address-based geo-blocking.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Contractual Prohibitions on Users Onboarding from Prohibited Jurisdictions. Users are notified at onboarding that Listor does not offer services in restricted jurisdictions. Listor's policy on restricting user activity stems from a combination of its risk, fraud prevention, and AML standards, as well as any assessments associated with the permissibility of its services in certain jurisdictions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-white">B. Enhanced Due Diligence and Ongoing Monitoring</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor performs ongoing monitoring on its users in order to detect any behaviours or indicators that might raise suspicions in regard to money laundering and terrorist financing practices. For that purpose, Listor has implemented a set of red flag indicators that help it determine such behaviours and require further action from Listor in assessing the customer information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Whenever one of those red flags is triggered, the user account will be suspended and Listor will pursue enhanced due diligence. Enhanced KYC diligence under this policy is deemed to include, but not limit to, the provision of:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Full legal name;</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Country of citizenship;</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Permanent Address (which, for an individual, must be a residential or business street address, and for an entity, must be a principal place of business, local office or other physical location);
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Identification number (either a taxpayer identification number, or, if unavailable, a passport number and country of issuance, alien identification card number or number and country of issuance of another government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard).
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Identification Document; and</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Source of Funds and Source of Wealth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor may use third party service provider to verify any of the above information as determined to establish a reasonable basis to know the true identity of the user where the user's activity warrants.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">C. Acceptance Policy</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor will not accept a and will block the users that:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Do not provide the identification information requested by Listor;</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Provide fake identification documents;</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Try to use different means to deceive about their location;</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Are from restricted or prohibited jurisdictions; or</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Are subjected to United States, European Union, or other global sanctions or watch lists;</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Are gambling addicted or have mental health issues;</li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">Its source of funds are originated or exchanges in restricted jurisdictions;</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor reserves the right to block and suspend player for any other reasons at its own description
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">Transactions Monitoring</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor is firmly committed to complying with economic and trade sanctions programs imposed by jurisdictions in which the firm conducts business. For that purpose Listor established a transaction monitoring program with controls and processes to identify and detect any unusual activity in real time and in its ongoing monitoring.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor will conduct ongoing monitoring on a regular basis using rule-based systems developed in-house and others from third-party vendors to review user history and patterns of activity to detect and report any unusual activity as required and to develop and implement any additional controls or limits in its platform.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor implemented procedures addressing the following two key components of unusual or suspicious activity management:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Identification of unusual activity through methods of identification may include employee and customer identification, law enforcement inquiries, other referrals, or transaction and surveillance monitoring system reports; and
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            alert management that focuses on processes used to investigate, evaluate and document identified unusual or potentially suspicious activity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Listor will use the following processes to achieve both goals:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Transaction Monitoring for Sanctioned or Prohibited Jurisdictions. Listor may in its reasonable discretion impose certain due diligence requests at user balance withdrawal. Listor presently conducts a mixture of manual and automated transaction monitoring processes to identify "red flag" behaviour. Where such red flag behaviour is identified, Listor may refuse to process any withdrawal attempts or collect additional information from the recipient. Listor will further endeavour to limit any attempted user account funding from prohibited jurisdictions (which are identified in the Listor user facing disclosures and updated from time to time internally) where the associated wallet address indicates that the user or the user's funds are located in such a prohibited jurisdiction. For instance, Listor may prohibit a user from funding their Listor account using a known U.S. based exchange wallet as such assets indicate that the user is a U.S. person. Users will have the ability to rebut any suspension with additional information as part of Listor's ongoing transaction monitoring and user due diligence standards.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Screening for Sanctioned Parties. Prior to issuing a Listor funding address to a user, Listor will screen user's wallet address against applicable sanctions databases. Such screening measures will rely on third party blockchain forensics vendors such as Chainalysis. Listor will periodically re-screen wallet addresses against such databases.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Identification of Unusual Activity. Listor will monitor account activity for unusual size, volume, pattern or type of transactions, taking account of risk factors and red flags that are appropriate to our business.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Anti-Money Measures. Listor will utilise software designed to detect other suspicious deposit or withdrawal patterns. Such instances will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, depending on the perceived level of risk. In such instances, a user may be required to explain their methodology and purpose for using the platform.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Chainalysis Review. Every single crypto deposit or withdrawal both indirect and direct will run through Chainalysis and reviewed for signs of fraud or suspicious behaviour. A user's account will be suspended and reviewed upon sign of potential illicit behaviour. Subject proof of verification may be requested from high-risk accounts. Listor may refuse to withdraw to certain "high-risk" addresses as determined in consultation with Chainalysis risk scoring.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Withdrawal Threshold KYC. Additionally, and independently, every account, wherever or with whomever associated, will be suspended until adequate KYC evidence occurs once that account reaches a withdrawal threshold dependent on the accounts risk characterisation over the life of the account.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">D. Other Ongoing Monitoring Controls</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Additionally to the above mentioned controlling procedures, Listor has also implemented the following procedures to complement its know your customer and ongoing monitoring procedures:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Ban Evasion Detection. In addition, Listor will utilise third-party service provider software designed to detect the use by one user of multiple accounts. This software relies on detection of links between the same devices used to access multiple accounts. Such instances will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, depending on the perceived level of risk. In such instances, a user may be required to explain their methodology and purpose for using the platform. Listor accounts are linked to always using local (non-custodial) or hosted (custodial) wallets. In addition to Chainalysis screening, Listor monitors user activity within the Listor platform and any withdrawals must meet Listor's and its third-party service provider's verification processes. Listor further prohibits peer-to-peer account transfers within the Listor platform infrastructure. Any attempts to circumvent this restriction will be treated as a red flag.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Geo-zone Monitoring. Listor has implemented time zone controls that detects the users device information and crosses it with restricted jurisdiction to understand if they are trying to use geo location software to hide the jurisdictions where they are connecting from.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Products and Services Review. Listor will establish additional procedures to avoid facilitating user attempts to exploit the Listor platform. Listor has a robust set of user-facing terms that users attest to in order to utilize the Listor platform. Listor will establish certain additional safeguards to mitigate against the risk of such misuse. For instance, Listor may establish policies or procedures for limiting which user assets can be onboarded to the Listor platform. Listor lists the assets that are available for use on the Listor platform. Listor does not allow the use of anonymity enhancing technologies such as mixers, tumblers, or certain coins and tokens. Where Listor becomes aware that an anonymity enhancing technology is being used on the Listor platform, Listor will disallow such use.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Vendor Management. Listor works with reputable third-party service providers as part of its compliance infrastructure. Listor will periodically assess the strength of its key third party service providers to determine if additional services are needed, the third-party service provider is not performing consistent with its contractual obligations, or if other remedial action is necessary for Listor to comply with this policy. Listor may request information from any third-party service provider as part of its vendor review process.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2 text-gray-300">
            Compliance Innovation. In addition to vendor management, Listor will continuously monitor any non documentary compliance mechanisms to determine their viability for the Listor program. Listor may run test or trial programs on a limited basis with such compliance vendors to determine the effectiveness of such programs. Blockchain native compliance tools include fraud prevention services, on-chain KYC providers, and other tools designed to reflect the technological features associated with blockchain platforms.
