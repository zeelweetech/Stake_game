                        For the majority of people, gambling is an enjoyable leisure and entertainment activity. But for some, gambling can have negative impacts. As a result, we have developed this policy to communicate our approach to responsible gambling and minimizing harm to consumers who may be vulnerable to problem gambling.

                    <p className="text-slate-300">
                        "Responsible Gambling" is a broad concept that aims to ensure gambling is conducted in a manner whereby the potential for harm associated with problem gambling is minimized. It respects the responsibility of individuals for their own actions, but also acknowledges a responsibility on the part of service providers.

                        Problem gambling occurs when a person loses control over their gambling, particularly the amount of money gambled and the amount of time devoted to gambling.
